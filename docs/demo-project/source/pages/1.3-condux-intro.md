## 1.3 Introduction to Condux

Although mkapp's architecture components communicate via websockets, we don't directly code to the websocket API because we want to stick to a uni-directional data-flow model. So instead, we'll be using a library called [Condux](http://www.npmjs.org/package/condux). Condux, and its complementary browser-side library [Condux-Client](https://www.npmjs.org/packag/condux-client), provide a way to send data from client to server datastores with actions, and react to updates from the server in real time via read-only streams called frequencies. If you've been using the flux pattern in your applications, Condux's workflow should come naturally. It's actually built around the popular flux-type library [reflux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reflux). If you're not familiar with the flux pattern yet, [Facebook's flux documentation](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html) is a good place to start.
