# mkapp Example Project

### Overview

In this tutorial we'll build a simple mkapp project that uses a color picker and some input fields to change the look and feel of our application dynamically. The tutorial is broken into two sections. The first covers the mkapp build system, in the second we'll build the actual app. By the end of the tutorial, you should have a fairly good understanding of mkapp components, themes, the Condux websocket API, and building your own components into mkapp. Clone the code from the [demo project repo](https://github.com/epferrari/mkapp-demo.git) and follow along by checking out tags as we progress.

Part 2: Building the App
## 1.3 Introduction to Condux

Although mkapp's architecture components communicate via websockets, we don't directly code to the websocket API because we want to stick to a uni-directional data-flow model. So instead, we'll be using a library called [Condux](http://www.npmjs.org/package/condux). Condux, and its complementary browser-side library [Condux-Client](https://www.npmjs.org/packag/condux-client), provide a way to send data from client to server datastores with actions, and react to updates from the server in real time via read-only streams called frequencies. If you've been using the flux pattern in your applications, Condux's workflow should come naturally. It's actually built around the popular flux-type library [reflux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reflux). If you're not familiar with the flux pattern yet, [Facebook's flux documentation](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html) is a good place to start.
